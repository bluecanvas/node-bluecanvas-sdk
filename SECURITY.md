# Security Policy

Security is something we prioritize at Blue Canvas. We believe that security is a process – it’s more than just firewalls and password rotation. Security is also about culture and policies. At Blue Canvas, we have set out to build a security-literate and conscious culture from day one. This ranges from the way we think about hiring and training, to the vendors that we select, to how we implement our systems.
